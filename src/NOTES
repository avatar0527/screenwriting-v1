01/01 Goals
- Enter Functions
General
Scene 
- after typing scene, press enter to go down a line AND change to action 
- If scene and empty, change to action 

action
- if empty, change to scene

Character 
- if empty press enter to go back to action 
- if not, go down a line and change to dialogue

dialogue
- if empty ??
- if not empty, go down a line and change to 
character 

problem
- when changing to and from action and scene, cursor is going up and down 
- tabbing with text already there
- go down far enough it should divide into pages

- Backspace Functions 
when backspacing, index should change to index of block type it is currently on. 

if (empty)
    if (action) {
        updateIndex to line above
        do normal thing 
    }
    if(!action) {

    }

create new state for Formats
create new formats array 

make sure when format is set, screenplay store + json is also updated 

- use redux to manage editorContent(for JSON database)
- once editorState is made into a redux thing, we can replace all the set states for action creators. 

- can't backspace when i actually want to
It's good that it isn't deleting the heading, but backspace should send me to previous line 

- currently the blocktype that is rendered is not dependent on optionINdex, it simply references it when blocktyp is requested  to be changed. instead, the block type should be dependent on optionIndex. this would make a lot of the logic a whole lot more simple
