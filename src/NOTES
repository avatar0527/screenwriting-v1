General
Scene

Character 
- if empty press enter to go back to action 
- if not, go down a line and change to dialogue

dialogue
- if empty ??
- if not empty, go down a line and change to character 



- Backspace Functions 
when backspacing, index should change to index of block type it is currently on. 

if (empty)
    if (action) {
        updateIndex to line above
        do normal thing 
    }
    if(!action) {

    }







- use redux to manage optionIndex, editorState, editorContent(for JSON database)

- can't backspace when i actually want to
It's good that it isn't deleting the heading, but backspace should send me to previous line 

- currently the blocktype that is rendered is not dependent on optionINdex, it simply references it when blocktyp is requested  to be changed. instead, the block type should be dependent on optionIndex. this would make a lot of the logic a whole lot more simple
