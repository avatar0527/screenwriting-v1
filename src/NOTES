GOAL FOR THE WEEK
- Toggle Different Screenplay Formats
- Find a way to index scenes 
- Restyle Lists page (should display format name as well)
- list page click on name to go to the thing 
- START WORKING ON BUSINESS SIDE 


Problems 
- Fix formatting problems with Korean Standard 
- Dropdown bugs out when clicking option 
- When editor loads, it loads with hollywood as default until user clicks on editor 
- Translate all to Korean
- googleauth load of undefined 




create new state for Formats
create new formats array 

make sure when format is set, screenplay store + json is also updated 

- can't backspace when i actually want to
It's good that it isn't deleting the heading, but backspace should send me to previous line 

- currently the blocktype that is rendered is not dependent on optionINdex, it simply references it when blocktyp is requested  to be changed. instead, the block type should be dependent on optionIndex. this would make a lot of the logic a whole lot more simple
